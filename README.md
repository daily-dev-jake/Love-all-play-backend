## Guest User Flow 
1. **Badminton Player** / Spectator / Judge can use **Love-all-play** as a **Guest User**.
2. **User** *enters* names of both **Players** for the corresponding sides of the net.
3. When a **Player** wins a **Game point**, the **User** has to *tap* on the court of the winning side.
4. Every time there is a new **Game** winner, the **Game scores** will be reset to 0 but the **Game point** will increase by one for the winner. The **Player Names** and corresponding **Game scores** will be *saved* into to their local phone. (*database* is only for registered users).
5. Eventually, after the best of 3 **Games**, the final **Match** winner will be victorious. Both **Games** and **Match points** will be reset.
6. **Users** will be able to see their past **scores** when needed.
